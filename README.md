# AP-LED8-THT
Alhambra Peripheral board with 8 through-hole LEDs

It is a tiny board with eight 3mm though-hole LEDs for connecting to the Alhambra-II FPGA board.  
This board is also used as a reference for teaching students how to design their first PCB (so, it is a kind of "hello world" hardware)
